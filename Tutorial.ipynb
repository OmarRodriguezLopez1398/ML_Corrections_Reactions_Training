        "\n",
        "## ✅ Key Takeaways\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Data preparation matters:** organizing reaction structures and adding metadata and isolated atoms is essential.  \n",
        "- **Visualization is helpful:** inspecting reaction pathways (R → TS → P) clarifies structural changes.  \n",
        "- **Direct learning and Δ-learning:**  \n",
        "  - We first trained a **MACE model on DFT energies** to predict atomization energies directly.  \n",
        "  - Then, using **GFN2-xTB as a baseline**, a **Δ-learning model** was trained to correct energies, improving barrier heights and reaction enthalpies even with limited data. You can find more complex trained models using other baselines [here](https://github.com/OmarRodriguezLopez1398/ML_corrections_BH_RE).  \n",
        "- **Evaluation shows improvement:** Δ-learning corrections significantly reduce errors compared to the baseline.  \n",
        "- **Modular workflow:** new reactions, models, or methods can be easily incorporated.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**📚 Task:** Within this tutorial folder, there are also two additional reaction families: **1,3 Insertion ROR** and **Retroene**. Try training the models using all available reactions and observe how the predictions improve.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial demonstrates how **ML can complement traditional computational chemistry**, providing a fast and accurate way to predict energies and reaction barriers, and serving as a foundation for more advanced studies.\n"
